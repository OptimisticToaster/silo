# silo

A project to practice development in Python and possibly other web technologies with a team looking to learn or mentor together.

There will be initial goals such as establishing the main models and CRUD interface. Later goals will be expand for additional apps.

## Communication

Use a Discord chat for general chat purposes.

## Ticketing

Need a system that easily provides issue and bug ticketing. MantisBT has worked pretty nicely. Or if it's a small group, possibly Markdown files.

## Log Work

Always remember that a major focus for this project is to demonstrate how to build a project. All steps provided will be included in the work-log directory with files. Name each file by your date and time stamp. Then describe what you did sufficiently that any random user could step through this project and recreate it.

## Repository

My original plan was to host on Github, and we all work together. Other option is we each develop individually, with a forum to help each other as we hit bumps.

# Plan

1. Find team
  1. Participants
  2. Agree that we all have other lives but try to check in every couple days
  3. NO HOSTILITY! Diverse ideas are fine, but any name calling or rudeness will get a ban.
2. Plan systems
  1. Github (as needed)
  2. Messaging
  3. Ticketing system (together or on own)
3. Select project option
4. Develop roadmap
