# Project 1: Quoter

Interface: Console

Purpose: Display famous quotes. Initially, provide a random quote, and later maybe more direction from the user.

## Structure

Database: Initially JSON, then possibly SQLite.

Programming Language: Python 3.10.2

Operating System: Windows

## Environment Setup

Most of the setup occurred with setting up the over-arching Silo system. The code base is fine to mix (ie Git), but want a separate environment for the application.

Change to the project directory.

### Create Virtual Environment

Using Poetry. Check that it is installed and is accessible by the path.

`poetry --version`
